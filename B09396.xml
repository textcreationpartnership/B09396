            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WIthout further Preamble, I shall take occasion from what passed at the Committee of Religion the other night, to give you my Thoughts upon the Book of <hi>John Toland</hi>'s; which indeed I never saw, till upon hearing it there spoken of, I procured it. I have since perused it with some Attention, but have not met with any of those learned Answers which, as is said, have been given to it; so that I shall only give you my naked thoughts, without any dress of Scholasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k terms: for I skill not the heavy weapons taken out of the Armory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.17.</note> I pretend not to combat with any other weapon than <hi>the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the Word of God.</hi> By That <hi>Luther</hi> overcame all his Antagonists, and by That, a greater than he, overcame the strong man arm'd,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.4, 7.10.</note> even <hi>Belzebub</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; a <hi>Scriptum est</hi> to every temptation soon chased away the Tempter.</p>
            <p>I must confess it is somewhat difficult to go about this matter, for the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary allows but a supposed Authority in the New Testament; so that when he pleases to take away, or deny his Hypothesis, all my Arguments must of course fall to the ground. He will allow nothing but the blurr'd Book of Reason, which in every man is different, according to their natural Capacity, Constitution, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Sense, or Education; tho, as to that in himself, he thinks it most perfect, able <hi>to search the hidden things of God,</hi> being <hi>vainly puffed up in his own mind.</hi>

            <p>First then, as to his Title, <hi>Christianity not Mysterious;</hi> if that Position be not Heresy, I know not what is. Heresy is an <hi>Erroneous belief in Fundamentals, joyn'd with a Pravity of Will;</hi> And that this is such, I shall prove. First, that it is an Erroneous belief; That Christianity is Mysterious, that we know not of it, neither in the nature of the thing, nor in degree, more than what God has been pleased to reveal to us, is most certain. Could any one comprehend before it was reveal'd, that God would send his Son our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to be born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to redeem us, and to take upon him our flesh? Well, and now that it is reveal'd, pray how much more of that ineffable Mystery can our Reason make out to us than what is revealed? Can we by Reason explain to our selves the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God, tho that he was inca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nate is fully revealed to us? Those words of his, <hi>John</hi> 14.20. <hi>that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you,</hi> fully reveal to us the Mystery of our Redemption, and of the Trinity,<note n="*" place="margin">In the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal it is not</note> yet what can we add to that Revelation? But further, the Operations of the Holy Spirit in our Souls what Reason can explain or conceive, <hi>it blows where it lists,</hi> and when, and how; It is of that very thing that it is said, that <hi>it is not entred into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> which yet <hi>God has revealed to us by his Holy Spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">but</note> No, every happy Soul that feels it must say, it is <hi>quod neque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f, he had not surely then come so near to that unpardonable Offence; which proves the second part of my Definition, a pravity of Will; That this is so is manifest, for his Errors tend to make Mankind miserable;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.

<pb facs="tcp:187989:2"/> Spirit that leads us into all Truth.</hi> If then this our Faith be vain, and that the supposed Influences and Motions of the Holy Spirit in our Souls are but Dreams and Enthusiasms, we are wretched Creatures; in the fallen Estate that we are, we had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Pravity of his Will is manifest in this, That this Doctrine must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fartly produce a Pravity of Will in Others; for if we have no supernatural As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance nor Guide, whatever our Reason does not Reproach us for, is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Religion and Sacraments. Our Church, upon the Foundation of the Holy Scriptures, has declared there are two Sacraments, that they are generally (that is,<note place="margin">Chur. Cat.</note> where they may be had) necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, that they are ordained by Christ himself, and the means whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace. But this Author defeats us of all these blessed Benefits at once, by calling them Ceremonies; which are but Rites, and generally of human Institution. But if we should say that they were of Divine Institution, as many of the Ceremonies of the Jews were, yet still as Ceremonies they are only Significative, and not Operative, as we believe, and many o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> us know and have felt the holy Sacraments to be. Here also see another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Pravity of his Will, in depriving all Mankind of this Means of Grace, and of the blessed Union thereby wrought between Christ and his Members.</p>
            <p>There are no particular Ceremonies made necessary under the Gospel; but our Lord has made his Sacraments necessary. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.</note> So that where Men come to the knowledge of Christ, it is not a belief alone tho never so Orthodox, no nor a good life joined to it, that will save them. For tho St. <hi>Peter</hi> declared to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> that in <hi>omn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note> And tho this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor labours so much to expose the solemnity of its celebration, we know that it was from the beginning the most essential part of the Christian Worship. We find the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. went up to the Temple at the hour of Prayer, to pray with the Jews; but their breaking of Bread, this holy Communion, was <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

            <pb facs="tcp:187989:3"/>
            <p>But to return from this Digression, and to shew you further his Contempt of our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he speaks of one of them in a manner that St. <hi>Paul</hi> never did, nor any good man beside. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. but this Author having Occasion four times to mention it, calls it only <hi>The Supper,</hi> as tho it were a Common Clubb or Collation.</p>
            <p>And since our Sacraments are so ill handled by him, what can we expect for our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? <hi>Your mock Anniversary Fasts,</hi> says he p. 158. and so he goes on to compare our Ceremonies with those of the Romish Church, and shews the latter to be full as proper and fignificative as ours. As I said before, I know not by what name to call him; he shews some Indignation at Popery, he ridicules the old Socinians with the Notion of a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Creature, and exposes us and indeed the Christian Religion it self at the same rate, whilest he makes all things, as he expresses it, to bow before the Majestick Light of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which according to him, is full Conviction of Reason, without making any Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the difference of Mens Capacities. So that I think without trangressing the Rules of Charity, there remains only for him that of a Heretick, which he seems also with some Vanity to expect, and which I think I have in some measure proved, tho if so short a Letter would have admitted it, I could have added much to what I have said at the beginning upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>I would not make up in railing what I want in Argument, but I think this is his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in Scripture language, that he is one of those<note place="margin">Animal in Oposition to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note>

               <hi>haters of God,</hi> tho his behaviour to our Lord Jesus Christ shews little less. Unhappy man! to hate or despise infinite love, him that loved us, and washed us from our Sins by his blood, and sanctifieth us by his holy Spirit, that is now our High Priest in the presence of God, that knows and has compassion on our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, and be saved. O poor wretch, thy Condemnation is of thy self; for <hi>if any manlove not the Lord Jesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note>
               <hi>let him be,</hi> yea he is, <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> accursed, and to be condemned at the last judgment: for <hi>there is none other Name known among men, from,</hi> or by <hi>whom we can be saved.</hi> Not to love <hi>him,</hi> and consequently not to abide in <hi>his</hi> love, is curse enough, yea the very Essence of all Malediction. And now let those consider this, whether within doors or without; and whether the Vindication, or even the Excusing this Book, or the Author, or the ridiculing, or otherwise baffling, the just Prosecution and Censure of it and him, be not truly the denying of our Saviour before men, and whether such may not assuredly expect to be denied of him, in the presence of his Father, and the Holy Angels, and all the World at the last day. We shall all of us one day stand in need of a Saviour: O let us take heed to secure him our Friend, the neglect of whose Salvation we shall one day so sadly rue. For my part upon this occasion in my station, <hi>Liberavi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam mean,</hi> let the Event be what it will, I remain, Dear Sir, Your most Humble Servant.</p>
